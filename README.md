# install-all

Simple script designed to run `npm install` in all folders one level deep that
contain a `package.json`

Born from the situation of having to set up a new development machine with over
30 different folders to run `npm install`. My motto is always "Work smarter, not
harder"

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install -g install-all
```

### Usage

```bash
$ install-all
```
